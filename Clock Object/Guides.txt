In assignment 78 we used objects of the class BoundedCounter to implement a clock in the main method. In this assignment we will tranform the clock to an object. The skeleton of the class clock looks like the following:

public class Clock {
    private BoundedCounter hours;
    private BoundedCounter minutes;
    private BoundedCounter seconds;

    public Clock(int hoursAtBeginning, int minutesAtBeginning, int secondsAtBeginning) {
      // the counters that represent hours, minutes and seconds are created and
      // set to have the correct initial values
    }

    public void tick(){
      // Clock advances by one second
    }

    public String toString() {
        // returns the string representation
    }
}
  
Copy the class BoundedCounter from assignment 78 to the project of this assignment!

Implement constructor and method tick for the class Clock. Use the following main to test your clock:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Clock clock = new Clock(23, 59, 50);

        int i = 0;
        while( i < 20) {
            System.out.println( clock );
            clock.tick();
            i++;
        }
    }
}
  
The output should be:

23:59:50
23:59:51
23:59:52
23:59:53
23:59:54
23:59:55
23:59:56
23:59:57
23:59:58
23:59:59
00:00:00
00:00:01
