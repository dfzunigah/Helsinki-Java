You will get the Graph component along with the exercise template. Graph draws graphs based on numbers that are given to it. You can give it numbers as follows:

Graph.addNumber(13.0);
        
We will create a program that draws a graph based on daily temperatures given to it.

EXERCISE 23.1: ASKING FOR NUMBERS
Create a program that asks the user to input floating point numbers (double) and then adds the numbers to the graph. Use the while-true structure again.

Note: To read a double, use: double number = Double.parseDouble(reader.nextLine());

EXERCISE 23.2: CHECKING
Improve your program so that temperatures below -30 degrees or over +40 degrees are ignored and not added to the graph.
