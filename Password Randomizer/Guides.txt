Your assignment is to expand the class PasswordRandomizer that has the following functionality:

The constructor PasswordRandomizer creates a new object, which uses the given password length.
The method createPassword returns a new password, which consists of symbols a-z and is of the length given as a parameter to the constructor
The frame of the class is as follows:

import java.util.Random;

public class PasswordRandomizer {
    // Define the variables here

    public PasswordRandomizer(int length) {
        // Format the variable here
    }

    public String createPassword() {
      // Write the code here which returns the new password
    }
}
    
In the following is a program that uses a PasswordRandomizer object:

public
class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PasswordRandomizer randomizer = new PasswordRandomizer(13);
        System.out.println("Password: " + randomizer.createPassword());
        System.out.println("Password: " + randomizer.createPassword());
        System.out.println("Password: " + randomizer.createPassword());
        System.out.println("Password: " + randomizer.createPassword());
    }
}
    
The output could look something like this:

Password: mcllsoompezvs
Password: urcxboisknkme
Password: dzaccatonjcqu
Password: bpqmedlbqaopq
    
Tip 1: this is how you turn the integer number into a character:

int number = 17;
char symbol = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".charAt(number);
