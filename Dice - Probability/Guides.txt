In the template is class Dice that has the following functionality:

The constructor Dice(int numberOfSides) creates a new dice object that has the amount of sides defined by the argument.
The method roll tells the result of a roll (which depends on the number of its sides)
The frame of the program is as follows:

import java.util.Random;

public class Dice {
    private Random random;
    private int numberOfSides;

    public Dice(int numberOfSides){
        this.numberOfSides = numberofSides;
        random = new Random();

    }

    public int roll() {
          // we'll get a random number in the range 1-numberOfSides<
    }
}
    
Expand the class Dice so that with each roll the dice returns a random number between 1...number of sides. Here is a main program that tests the dice:

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dice dice = new Dice(6);

        int i = 0;
        while ( i < 10 ) {
            System.out.println( dice.roll() );
            i++;
        }
    }
}
    
The output could look something like this:

1
6
3
5
3

2
