The template you get from the test automaton has a start for an implementation of binary search. The class BinarySearch holds a method public static boolean search(int[] array, int searchedValue), the job of which is to figure out, by using binary search, if the value given as a parameter is in the sorted array that is also given as parameter.

The method search does not work yet, however. Finish the method's implementation into a real binary search.

For testing, a separate main program can be found in the class Main, which has a frame like this:

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Here you can test binary search
        int[] array = { -3, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12 };
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Values of the array: " + Arrays.toString(array));
        System.out.println();

        System.out.print("Enter searched number: ");
        String searchedValue = reader.nextLine();
        System.out.println();

        boolean result = BinarySearch.search(array, Integer.parseInt(searchedValue));

        // Print the binary search result here
    }
}
  
The execution of the program looks like this:

Values of the array: [-3, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12]

Enter searcher number: 8

Value 8 is in the array
  
Values of the array: [-3, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 12]

Enter searcher number: 99

Value 99 is not in the array
