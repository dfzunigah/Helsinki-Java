EXERCISE 40.1: PRINTING STARS AND WHITESPACES
Create a method printWhitespaces(int size) that prints the given amount of whitespaces. Them method should not print a line break.

Reimplement or copy the method printStars(int size) from the previous exercise.

EXERCISE 40.2: PRINTING A RIGHT-ALIGNED TRIANGLE
Create the method printTriangle(int size) that prints a triangle using the mehtods printWhitespaces and printStars. Note: do not print anything in the method itself, just call the helper methods to do the actual printing.

For example, the method call printTriangle(4) has the following output:

   *
  **
 ***
****
    
EXERCISE 40.3: PRINTING A CHRISTMAS TREE
Create the method xmasTree(int height) that prints a Christmas tree using the mehtods printWhitespaces and printStars. A Christmas tree consists of a triangle of given height and a stand. The stand is two stars tall and three stars wide and it is located in the center of the bottom of the triangle. Note: do not print anything in the method itself, just call the helper methods to do the actual printing.

The method call xmasTree(4), for example, has the following output:

   *
  ***
 *****
*******
  ***
  ***
    
The method call xmasTree(10) has the following output:

         *
        ***
       *****
      *******
     *********
    ***********

Second note: You don't need to worry about heights below 3!
